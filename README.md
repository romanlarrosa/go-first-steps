# Go First Steps

This repository contains the code generated following the first three tutorials from [the go.dev official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/)

This is not an exact copy of the tutorials as I've been integrating all the content in only one repo instead of creating three different ones

## Execution
To execute the resultant program, GO should be installed in the machine, and then from the repo root execute:

```console
foo@bar:~$ go run ./hello
```
