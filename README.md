# Go First Steps

This repository contains the code generated following the first four tutorials from [the go.dev official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/)

This is not an exact copy of the tutorials as I've been integrating all the content in only one repo instead of creating different ones

## Hello

This module includes the code generated by the first three tutorials:

- [Getting Started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started.html)
- [Create a module](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/create-module.html)
- [Multi-module workspaces](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces.html)


To execute the resultant program, GO should be installed in the machine, and then from the repo root execute:

```console
foo@bar:~$ go run ./hello
```

## Database
To set up the database we will be using a free hosting service [railway](https://railway.app/)
After setting up the database, we will create a table and insert some data (See [this sql file](./data-access/data/create-tables.sql)).

To properly connect the database update the [.env.example file](./data-access/data/.env.example) renaming it to `.env` and updating its values.

To execute the resultant program, GO should be installed in the machine, and then from the `./data-access` directory execute:

```console
foo@bar:~$ go run .
```
